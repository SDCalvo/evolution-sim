// This makes imports cleaner: import { ComponentName } from '@/components'

// UI components will be exported here as we create them
// export { default as Button } from './ui/Button';
// export { default as Card } from './ui/Card';

// Simulation components
export { SimulationCanvas } from "./simulation/SimulationCanvas";
export { ControlPanel } from "./simulation/ControlPanel";

// Chart components will be exported here as we create them
// export { default as FitnessChart } from './charts/FitnessChart';
