## Notes

- Start very slowly with neural networks to ensure deep understanding
- Focus on one feature at a time
- Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
- Document learnings and insights throughout
- Prioritize understanding over speed of development
- Keep the scope manageable but extendable
- **Phase 4 (Lifetime Learning) is optional** - can be implemented after core evolution system is working
- Compare pure evolution vs evolution+learning to understand contribution of each mechanism
